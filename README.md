============

This is a project where I try to learn more about Autotools, C Unit testing,
GNU C coding standards, OO-concepts in standard C and all that jazz.
If it turns out to become a useful library, that's a bonus!


Usage
-----

Configure, build & run tests
```
$ autoreconf --install
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check
$ bash tests/plot.sh
```
